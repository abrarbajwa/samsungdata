Contains data extracted from Samsung Human Activity Regcognition dataset and files explaining the transformation
Extracted and transformed by Abrar ul Haq
The original data is based on experiments carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years to study human activity recognition. Details of the orginal dataset are available in the data's readme file.
